Changelog
=========


4.0.3 (unreleased)
------------------

- Use collections.abc for ABC import to add Python 3.9 compatibility.


4.0.2 (2019-11-04)
------------------

- A solution for the setup.cfg [Alex Gr√∂nholm]


4.0.1 (2019-11-03)
------------------

- The pure setup.cfg config didn't work. All the tests pass fine,
  but when installing the package somewhere else, nothing gets installed.
  So I'm reverting that change for now.


4.0 (2019-11-02)
----------------

- Moved all the information from setup.py into setup.cfg.

- Added a Close() command which is different from a Line() command in
  no way at all, to simplify the handling of closepath commands and subpaths.

- Path()'s no longer have a `closed` attribute.

- Now fully supports the SVG 1.1 "F.6.2 Out-of-range parameters" list.

- Uses circular maths to calculate the length of circular arcs,
  more accurate and much faster.


3.1 (2019-10-25)
----------------

- The Move null command was not imported into ``__init__.py`` [blokhin]
- #41: Switched from ``pkg_resource``-style namespace
  package for ``svg`` to a `pkgutil style
  <https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#pkgutil-style-namespace-packages>`_
  namespace package.
- A faster ``point()`` implementation for paths. [ClayJarCom]
- Dropped support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.3.
- Added support for Python 3.7 and 3.8.


3.0 (2018-08-14)
----------------

- Dropped support for Python 3.1 and 3.2. It still works, but it may stop.
  Added support for Python 3.6. Dropped support for Jython, it's not
  supported by Travis, and hasn't seen  a release in over a year.

- #33: Move commands are now preserved when parsed.

- Subpaths are no longer merged even if they are joined.

- #30: Arcs where the endpoint is the same as the start point caused a crash.
  The SVG specs say that it instead should be the equavalent of skipping
  that section, which now is the case.


2.2 (2016-10-15)
----------------

- Don't add a line when closing a path if it's not needed.


2.1.1 (2016-02-28)
------------------

- #18: QuadraticBeziers could get a DivideByZero error under certain
  circumstances. [MTician]

- Accept an error parameter to Path.point() to be able to
  control error vs performance setting. [saschwarz]

- #25: Arc's could create a MathDomain error under certain circumstances.

- #17: Set last_command always.


2.0.1 (2015-10-17)
------------------

- #20: The doctext for the closed() setter was incorrect.

- #19: Fixed so tests didn't use relative paths. [danstender]


2.0 (2015-05-15)
----------------

- Nothing changed yet.


2.0b1 (2014-11-06)
------------------

- Added a Path.d() function to generate the Path's d attribute.

- Added is_smooth_from() on QubicBezier and QuadradicBezier.

- Path()'s now have a .closed property.

- Fixed the representation so it's parseable.

- The calculations for CubicBezier and Arc segments are now recursive,
  and will end when a specific accuracy has been achieved.
  This is somewhat faster for Arcs and somewhat slower for CubicBezier.
  However, you can now specify an accuracy, so if you want faster but
  looser calculations, you can have that.

- 't' segments (smooth, relative QuadraticBeziers) whose previous segment was
  not a QuadraticBezier would get an incorrect control point.


1.2 (2014-11-01)
----------------

- New Quadradic Bezier implementation. [Justin Gruenberg]

- Solved issue #6: Z close path behavior. [abcjjy]


1.1 (2013-10-19)
----------------

- Floats with negative exponents work again.

- New tokenizer that is around 20 times faster.


1.0 (2013-05-28)
----------------

- Solved issue #2: Paths with negative values and no spaces didn't work.
  [regebro]


1.0b1 (2013-02-03)
------------------

- Original release.
