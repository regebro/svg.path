Justin Gruenberg implemented the Quadradic Bezier calculations and
provided suggestions and feedback about the d() function.

Michiel Schallig suggested calculating length by recursive straight-line
approximations, which enables you to choose between accuracy or speed.
Steve Schwarz added an error argument to make that choice an argument.

ClayJarCom speeded up `point()` calculations for paths.

Thanks also to bug fixers Martin R, abcjjy, Daniel Stender, MTician,
blokhin, Karthikeyan, jaraco, martinleopold and twjang.

Thanks to tatarize for help with investigating issues, and coming with
much feedback and ideas.

Samuel Carlsson [vidstige] provided the `tangent()` functions.

Lucas Simon discovered and fixed that not all path segments preserved

Taewoong Jang [twjang] implemented boundingbox functions. 

Benjamin Drung [bdrung] added a font to make tests non-flakey.
